# Wrapping Up

And that is all! We've just created a Contentful-Algolia integration which keeps our index updated with data being served from Contentful, and we're able to fetch and filter the data incredibly fast using the Algolia API.

You can continue playing with this project adding more facets or syncing more fields from Contentful, the search UI can be extended to fit a lot of your needs.

You could also create your own webhook instead of using the Template that Contentful provides and apply some business logic to the data you want to store, you might also want to flat the entry to only save the fields.

While this tutorial focuses on some basic Algolia features, it provides a lot more! such as sorting, search recommendations, ranking, pagination and of course, AI search! I encourage you to continue learning and get the most from the Algolia engine to achieve the desired user experience.

Happy coding everyone!
